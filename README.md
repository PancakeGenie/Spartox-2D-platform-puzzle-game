# Spartox

Developed in Unreal Engine 4. Game is being developing mainly with C++, blueprints nodes are used, but not as much. 

Game is a simple puzzle platformer where you switch control between two controllable players and need to collect the key before reaching the end platform.
It's played on 2D plane but designed in 3D space.

Players controlls:
A - Move left
D - Move right
R - Restart level
Space - Jump
Shift - Switch player (disabled for majority of first level)
Escape - Opoen menu

Each controllable player has a different ability. Experiment to find them out.

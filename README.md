# Spartox

Developed with Unreal Engine 4. Game is being developing mainly with C++. Blueprints nodes are used, but not as much. 
It's my first game and I am using it to learn how to program UE4 games with C++ and BP's. It might have a lot of mistakes.
If someone stumbles upon this masterpiece, have fun with all the bu... "features" it has!

Game is a simple puzzle platformer where you control 2 players and need to collect the key and reach the end platform.
It's played on 2D plane but designed in 3D. Really nothing much more to say. Just a couple of boxes you contrl and move around. 
Very creative, much wow.

Anyway, any criticism is welcomed, I wish to improve so don't go easy on me by pulling the punches! I have a really thick skin, so go right ahead.
Things that I want to add now:

To do now:
1) Create at least 3 levels (tutorial + 2 more levels)
2) Add special ability for each of the two players (red and blue)
3) Fix jump
4) Fix bounce of wall
5) Fix camera stutter on collision
5) Create a few more models that are needed (key, end level platform, begin level platform, etc.)

In future:
1) Add particle effects
2) Add some animations
3) Add sound
4) Create a background (this fog is making me nauseated)

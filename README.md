# Spartox

Developed with Unreal Engine 4. Game is being developing mainly with C++. Blueprints nodes are used, but not as much. 
It's my first game and I am using it to learn how to program UE4 games with C++ and BP's. It might have a lot of mistakes.
If someone stumbles upon this masterpiece, have fun with all the bu... "features" it has!

Game is a simple puzzle platformer where you switch control between 2 controllable players and need to collect the key before reaching the end platform.
It's played on 2D plane but designed in 3D space. Really nothing much more to say. Just a couple of boxes you control by moving, jumping, destroying objects and picking up a key to reach the end level. Very creative, much wow.

The only thing it has is a tutorial, which is still incomplete. Never did level design, nor did I use trigger boxes, so I am working on creating the tutorial level before continuing to work on players/interactable objects.

Anyway, any criticism is welcomed, I wish to improve so don't go easy on me by pulling the punches! I have a really thick skin, so go right ahead.
